Test 1: Trying pre visualization phase (timepoints 1-10)

Test 2: All timepoints, seg_parameters middle = 0.3

Test 3: Test 2 was too laggy, I need to lower the middle seg parameter tso get less cells, trying 0.15. Just ai segmentations

Test 4: Testing ref_list output

test 5: trying manual on sid's germarium by iterating thru tps and slices.

test 6: Same as test 5 but trying AI segmentation and AI segmentation formatter

test 7: trying new method of manual formatting			--- Just half of germarium alone

Test 8: Same as 7 but on Sid's G6 because it was messed up on A1. Figured out what it was. I switched the center x and y coordinates when calculating the arctan

Test 9: Trying new method on Germarium  6, all timepoints

Test 10: Same as 9 but on 300 dpi timepoints. Only 1 timepoint. Seeing if flower bug doesn't happen

Idea, make bevel depth (width of wireframe) changeable by iterating thru every object

Test 11: Formatting Ctracker thing. Doesnt work on slices 6 and 7 for some reason

Test 12: New manual formatter on A1

Test 13: Tried Ctracker thing. Failiure again.

Test 14: Germarium 6 manual data, done by amy

Test 15: New way to format AI data
